# Markdown

Markdown is yet another format. I know many of them now. We have so many that it's becoming annoying. Just pick one that does everything possible and makes no sense.

## Examples

Headers
```
# Same as <h1>
## Same as <h2>
### Same as <h3>
... on so on
```

Italic
```
*Some Text*
_Some Text_
```

Bold
```
**Some Text**
__Some Text__
```

Bold and Italic
```
***Some Text***
___Some Text___
```

Unordered Lists
```
* One
* Two
    * Two A
    * Two B
```

Ordered Lists
```
1. One
1. Two
    1. Two A
    1. Two B
```

Links
```
[Alt Text](url)

or just write the URL (automatic)

https://<some url>
```

Images
```
![Alt Text](url)
```

BlockQuotes
```
The person once said:

> This is a blockquote line one
> This is the blockquote line two
```

Inline Code
```
Here's that `<html>` tag you were asking for.
```
